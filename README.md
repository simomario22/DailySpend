# DailySpend
An iOS app to keep track of how much money you have to spend per day.

DailySpend helps you keep your spending in check by incrementally "paying" you a given amount in increments over a period of time, for example "$1000 per month, paid daily". 

If you overspend one day, your debt will roll over to the next day, where you can spend less to "make up" for it. Similarly, you can underspend in order to "save up" for future days. At the end of the month, by default, your balance is final.

Breaking down your daily spending into manageable parts helps you better contextualize how each expense fits into your overall budget. 

The app is designed to let you quickly enter in all of your expenses manually - not only does this let you include expenses from non credit cards, but it forces you to think about your balance every time you buy something.

Coming to the App Store soon with several new features!
